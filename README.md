# MATLAB Simulation Code for Paper "Capacity of a Binary Channel with a Time-Bounded Adversary"

## Overview
This .mlx file simulates the performance of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) decoding in 5G New Radio (NR) systems under adversarial interference. It evaluates the system using different modulation and coding schemes (MCS) and adversarial strategies while considering realistic parameters from 5G standards. Performance metrics such as Bit Error Rate (BER) and Block Error Rate (BLER) are calculated over varying Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels.

---

## Features
- **Modulation Types:** Supports 64-QAM and 256-QAM.
- **MCS Types:** Three options for coding rates:
  - `conservative`: Low code rate for robust decoding.
  - `moderate`: Balanced code rate for average performance.
  - `aggressive`: High code rate for high data throughput.
- **Base Graphs:** Implements 5G NR LDPC Base Graphs 1 (BG1) and 2 (BG2).
- **Adversarial Models:**
  - `no adv`: No adversarial interference.
  - `minimax`: Worst-case adversary.
  - `fix flip`: Targeted bit flipping.
- **Decoding Options:**
  - Thresholded Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) clipping for improved robustness.
  - Early termination for efficient decoding.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - BER and BLER calculated across multiple SNR levels and adversarial strategies.

## Requirements
### **Software**
- MATLAB 

### **Toolboxes**
- Communications Toolbox (for QAM modulation/demodulation and LDPC encoding/decoding).
- Parallel Computing Toolbox (optional, for parallel execution).

## Usage Instructions

1. **Set Simulation Parameters:**
   - Modify `modulation` to `'64QAM'` or `'256QAM'`.
   - Choose `mcsType` as `'conservative'`, `'moderate'`, or `'aggressive'` based on desired coding rate.
   - Adjust other simulation parameters, including `numTrials`, `flipProb`, and `maxNumIter`.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script in MATLAB. Intermediate results (BER, BLER) will be displayed for each method and SNR level.

3. **Outputs:**
   - BER and BLER for all SNR levels and adversarial strategies are stored in arrays.
   - Results are saved in a `.mat` file named based on modulation, MCS, and Base Graph (e.g., `256QAM_moderate_BG1_results.mat`).
   - Graphs:
     - BER vs. SNR (`Figure 1`).
     - BLER vs. SNR (`Figure 2`).

4. **Adjust Simulation Details:**
   - Modify the number of decoding iterations (`maxNumIter`) or the SNR range (`SNRdB`) as needed.
   - Add or remove adversarial strategies by editing the `advType` array.
